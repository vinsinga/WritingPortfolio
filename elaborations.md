It is difficult for me, in the way that I have decided is necessary, to elaborate  on what I wrote. The prose here is, above all else, letters and words. Nearly meaningless alone, they should have meaning together, put into sentences and essays. If I wrote well, these essays should elaborate themselves without my further intervention. They should be both self contained and interlocking.


So maybe I won’t elaborate. Maybe I can’t without contradicting my prior claims that I did good work. This is just an extension of my reflections that will hopefully be different, somehow…


I definitely don’t sound the same across this whole body of work. One of my engagements during this course was the search for my writing voice. What should I sound like when I hit a page? I don’t know if I’ve found it yet. Who am I in this small fragment of myself? How should somebody feel when they look at my words? I don’t know. Each and every one of these essays was an experiment in so many ways. I love the all of all of them and don’t know how I could part with any of my former mes who wrote those words, or the tiny selves that edited them.


I wrote in my reflections that these essays had no common theme, but that was a falsity, perhaps a bold-faced lie. They’re all about people; they’re all about me. They’re all about the way we relate with each other and with ourselves and there’s no elaboration past that.
