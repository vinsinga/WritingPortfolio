There is a man sitting in the chair next to me with a macbook in his lap. He appears very irritated, constantly scratching under his collar and shaking when he types on his laptop. “What was communicated was not what was intended…” He is wearing large headphones and speaking loudly. I am trying not to stare, not to be noticed observing a hilarious spectacle. His headphones are accompanied by a pair of jeans and a blue plaid button down shirt. “It was communicated poorly and that just happened to coincide with this clusterfuck.” He’s been rambling about some tech thing for a while now. He is giving commands about ordering different parts and coordinating with engineers, talking like he’s running a company. Why is he sitting here in Starbucks? “I’m concerned for you, Mike.” he reaches over and fiddles with his phone that’s plugged into an outlet on the wall. As he starts talking about the prospect of “Android versus IOS and how we can convert the Java to Swift,” he appears to become infinitely more irritated the longer he listens without talking, bottling all of that up, shaking it, and popping the cap to let the bottle explode in whatever he says next. He is a white man who looks to be in his fifties. [I am having an extraordinarily hard time thinking of some sort of thesis, but I want it to go here.]

There has to be another interesting person. Who can I write about next? Five little girls, maybe ten years old, come running through the bookstore, into the cafe and onto the chairs at the table across from where I am sitting. Two of them look Indian and three of them look white. Excitedly, their leader, one of the Indian girls, jumps up on her chair and announces “anybody who wants food, follow me!” They all run towards the barista. An Indian woman walks through the door just in time for a girl to grab her by the wrist and usher her towards the rest of them to pay for what they all ordered. If she's their mother, I thought briefly, three of them must be adopted. I shake my head and realize just how presumptuous that was right before a white woman joins the Indian woman at a table for two. One of the girls runs up to her and asks for her camera. “Take an artsy one!” She hands it to the girl.

The girl runs in past the entrepreneur who looks startled by some words that must have just rang in his ear. He clicks a few buttons and throws down his headphones. He snaps his Mac Book closed and slides it into his bag, zipping it hastily. I thought that he was in a hurry until he picked up his phone. Maybe he got some news? Maybe he forgot?

There was a white woman with the pan-African colors on her shirt sitting at a table with another woman and a baby in a stroller. I missed my chance to write about those two; they’ve already left.

This Starbucks is inside a Barnes and Noble. I can only imagine how much the noise annoys people who are looking for books. Not that I care. I love it! All of the people talking on the phone and to each other, alone and together, speaking privately in public are so entertaining. People are fun to watch, to listen to They give me something to write about.

The entrepreneur just remembered his sense of urgency and left the store.

The little girls are still taking pictures of each other. I wonder why they’re not in school. It is the early afternoon. Perhaps they are home schooled. When I was home schooled, it was not infrequent that I would meet up with other home schooled children in bookstores. The two women and their daughters are getting up and walking out the door. Everything is so quiet now. I can hear the music playing. I’ve been listening to it absentmindedly for a few minutes.

The woman with the pan-African t shirt walked by again. She’s not a woman I realize, she’s a teenage girl. The woman that she was sitting with is by her side, but the baby’s nowhere in sight.

An older woman just sat down next to me a few chairs over. She looks a bit like a professor. She has a stack of papers, all with MLA headings in her lap and a red pen. She looks angry. The essays that she is grading must not be very good. She’s talking with a young woman, who might be in her early twenties; they don’t look related. The girl keeps bringing her books and telling her about them. Several times, the professor has said “I’m not buying that for you.” She has, however, taken a few books and placed them on the table next to her.

There are now about three boys who look to be in middle school wandering through the store. Have I been sitting here so long that they are out of school and only written this much? One of those boys has sat down at a table across from me. He is working on what I can only assume to be homework. He has a paper can a pencil. He is without an adult.

The barista has been talking for several minutes now, about how he does not have ice cream. “There is a Bruster’s or a Cold Stone, or something like that over there.” I cannot see who he is talking to. He does not sound annoyed, just bored. Even a little happy. Whoever he is talking to, he seems to appreciate the break from the monotony. “Hey man, how's it going?” He greets a young boy who he seems to know. “I’m great; could I have a salted caramel mocha?” “Yeah man, you still working across the street?” “Sure am.” From the boy’s voice, I thought he was far too young to have a job.
The professor is still marking essays with her pen. It’s been awhile since she’s turned the page, but she hasn’t stopped staring intensely at the paper and writing in its margins. I can only imagine how long it will take her to get through her stack if she takes such care with each one. Her accomplice is pacing the aisles, always with a book in her hand. Wearing a smile on her face, she looks like she is in love with each one. Finally, she has just now settled into a chair with one book.

The boy who is working on his homework is hunched so intensely that he will
surely develop back issues. This reminds me to fix my own posture.

What would somebody think if they looked at me and thought about me? There's a boy in a blue T-shirt who keeps looking nervously around. He looks tired and bored, yet strangely interested. Why did he just look at me?

My hands are shaking now. There are seven billion people in this world. I have seen maybe forty in this store today. All people, at least occasionally, do interesting things. I’ve just watched a few going about their daily lives, acting as they do every day. There are seven billion people just as interesting as them, just as interesting as me. Have people watched me? Written about me? Observed some of my mannerisms? If they have, they’ve looked through a very thin, tinted window into my life. Just as I have to these people. There is a woman sitting at that table with a cup from Chikfila, a notepad, and a binder. There’s a boy playing video games in that chair. There’s an old man sitting over there with a newspaper. There are so many people pacing the isles, looking at books. A sad man is in the history isle. He is standing there hunched over with a book about war.

Now it is time to bid farewell to my friends and acquaintances who I may well never meet again. Next time you are out, obey your pastor and take a moment to greet those around you.
