My friend and karate mentor was visiting in May, Memorial Day weekend, for a karate seminar in Atlanta. Afterwards, he stayed to go sightseeing. I took the short, sixty year old Brazilian man, who always wears a mischievous smile to complement his glasses, to the aquarium. He is a man who is completely obsessed with karate. He rarely chooses an appropriate time to indulge. In the parking lot, while our mutual friends were collecting their children and themselves, he was throwing punches and kicks into the air.

As our group walked through the aquarium, I had to stop him from this on more than one occasion. We saw a trained dolphin show there and I had to force him back into his seat in the middle of it. I used to wonder why he told me he has so much trouble in airports and now was worried every time I saw a security guard. The greatest shock came when near the cold water quest exhibit and he tapped on my shoulder. In broken English he said "look, I want to teach you this." Naturally, I was terrified and turned around just in time to see beginning of a combination that I knew ended in a kick. I couldn't move fast enough to save the man that my friend did not see walking in front of him. “Even with his glasses, he’s blind” she laughed and sighed. What could I say?

Obviously, I didn't say anything. Relative to all the people who have lived, who have said things, I say very little. Usually it is not I who says something, but he who says something. Or, in this story, it was she. She said the only thing that she could think to say: "I'm so sorry; he doesn't speak English!" My friend screamed those words, telling me this story, her story.

I have never watched my black, adopted father be arrested in southern California by a racist officer who assumed that my sister and I had been abducted. I have never waited in the police station for my mother to bring my birth certificate and free my dad. I don't even know any other of the other details of this experience. I am sure that it was very traumatic and I am sure that she remembers it well enough that she could have told them to me if she wanted to. Would she have wanted to if I had asked? I will never experience the same sort of tension with law enforcement that her father might have experienced every day and I will likely never experience an unwarranted arrest of this absurdity, nor will any relative of mine. I am not my acquaintance.

If I was the boy whose car caught fire outside the home of a girl from my church, who I intended to ask to prom, who exactly would I be? I would have had the distinct pleasure of meeting myself. I never would have had the chance to live my life and I never would have gotten to hear that story. My friend never did make it to prom that year, not because his fuel injector exploded. I have also never walked off a fast food job because management had told me that my training day was during my prom and then told me that I missed the actual date a week after it passed like him.

My government professor once defended a man who he called Kevin. Kevin, a twenty-something who had recently immigrated from Columbia, had attempted to buy cocaine from his friend who still lived there through mail. The package was sniffed out by a dog in the post office. Armed with a warrant, among other armaments, the police observed the delivery of the parcel. An older woman came out of the appartment and got the mail. The police knocked on the door of the apartment and asked her to whom the cocaine belonged. Kevin had left, somehow undetected, with the cocaine. She told them that the package was for her son, Kevin, and that he was at his girlfriend's apartment, not knowing where his girlfriend lived, she directed the officers to her workplace. The hotel management happily disclosed her address. This time warrantless, the police entered and searched the apartment to find a bag of cocaine, but not Kevin.

The officers returned to Kevin's mother’s apartment and placed him under arrest. The objective was to make him confess an intent to sell. Three times he was questioned and three times he denied. After his second denial, the officers threatened to arrest his mother too. Again he denied. “Book her” the words were barked. He confessed.

The illegalities in obtaining the two pieces of evidence which supported the case were obvious and Kevin's defense easily had them removed from the case and nearly won the whole trial with the same ease. The only thing left was for Kevin to be examined. This was rehearsed between the lawyer and the defendant, foolproof.

This story is inadequate to be told in scene. It has been watered down and stripped of its visual air. Still, no story is accepted by our minds contextless and without imagery. We make these things up where they lack. I can imagine a small courtroom, perhaps twenty people in the room. Kevin, his mother, maybe his girlfriend. The judge sitting on a lofty stag and a stenographer to his side. Two or three people working on prosecution. An observing student sits in the back, underdressed in a T-shirt and jeans, taking verbatim notes with disinterest. The jury is composed of seven older men and five older women. Kenny takes the stand. He knows the question; he knows the reply. “What happened after the police entered your apartment?” “I walked in” he starts “and put the cocaine down on the counter.” Surely some jaws were lowered and some eyes opened before my professor shouted. Did that student look up? “Objection, your honor, my client did not understand the question. I asked what happened after the police entered the apartment.”

I don't even remember the point of this story. What did our teacher intend to demonstrate? Maybe it was about due process or perhaps living with integrity. It could have been about making how a person can have the best support in the world but that not be enough without their sing it. I quite like that explanation. Maybe he didn't want it...

If I were a more interesting person, I would start every speech, every essay, every string of words with an amazing anecdote. If I were older, having lived a longer life, I would write a memoir of stories from my years, with the lessons I have learned. If I were a wiser man, I wouldn't need anecdotes to prove any of my points. If I were a better writer I would find a way to project a voice with all of these traits.
