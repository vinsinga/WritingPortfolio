My friend and karate mentor was visiting in May. I took the short, sixty year old Brazilian man, who always wears a mischievous smile to complement his glasses, to the aquarium. He is a man who is completely obsessed with karate. He rarely chooses an appropriate time to indulge. In the parking lot, while all of the parents from the dojo were getting their children out of their cars, he was throwing punches and kicks into the air.

As our group walked through the aquarium, I had to stop him from this on more than one occasion. We saw a trained dolphin show there and I had to force him back into his seat in the middle of it. I used to wonder why he told me he has so much trouble in airports. I was worried every time I saw a security guard. The greatest shock came when we were near the cold water quest exhibit and he tapped on my shoulder. In broken English he said "look, I want to teach you this." Naturally, I was terrified and turned around just in time to see beginning of a combination that I knew ended in a kick. I couldn't move fast enough to save the man that my friend did not see walking in front of him. What could I say?

Obviously, **I** didn't say anything. Relative to all the people who have lived, who have said things, I say very little. Usually it is not **I** who says something, but **he** who says something. Or, in this story, it was **she**. *She* said the only thing that she could think to say: "I'm so sorry; he doesn't speak English!" I was not there when this happened. My friend told me this story.

I have never watched my black, adopted father be arrested in southern California by an officer who thought that my sister and I had been abducted. I have never waited in the police station for my mother to bring my birth certificate and free my dad. I am not my acquaintance.

If I was the boy whose car caught fire outside the home of a girl from my church, who I intended to ask to prom, who exactly would I be? I would have had the distinct pleasure of meeting myself. I never would have had the chance to live my life and I never would have gotten to hear that story. My friend never did make it to prom that year, not for his fuel injector exploding. I have also never walked off a fast food job because management had told me that my training day was during my prom and then told me that I missed the actual date a week after it passed like him.
