I haven't been able to get this work into nearly the shape that I wanted to have it in by now. I have been working on *Change* and *Painting Portraits of Unknowing Subjects* for a while now, but I have really been struggling trying to revise and complete them. I started writing *Telling Secondhand Stories* on Sunday after spending a lot of time this weekend drafting ideas for it. I am really excited for that essay.
