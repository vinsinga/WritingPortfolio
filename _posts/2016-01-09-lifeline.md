<!--
- 2001 - On the 14th of July, I entered this world, in such a miserable place as Florida.
- 2002 - My family moved to Georgia.
- 2007 - I began elementary school.
- 2009 - By this year, I had already done most of the living
  that I have so far... but little of what's worth writing.
- 2010 - I began home school.
- 20015 - I began University.

This is a rather brief and lacking outline of my life.

## Fall 2015

  ### School

  I began university at KSU.

  ### Politics

  This is about the time that I started to attempt to think about politics. I suppose I was a libertarian.

  Really, I knew very little about politics.

  ### Music

  My favorite band was Pink Floyd. In fact, I think that might have been all that I listened to.
  ### People

  I met a lot of people who influenced in this time:

  - Josh
  - Josh
  - Samantha

  - Yannik

  - Tristen
  - Caleb

## 2016

  ### Politics

  Towards the beginning of this year, I read sociology, philosophy, and political theory pretty veraciously. I developed a somewhat leftist libertarianism.

  Later, my interest in politics transformed into an apathy. Politics started to feel silly and useless. It's not that I don't care, just that I think there are better ways to affect society than thinking about and support candidates.

  ### Music

  Favorite bands: Against Me! and Caravan Palace

  ### Interests

  - Programming
  - Sociology (I CLEPed sociology in the summer)
  - Mathematics (I taught myself and CLEPed calculus in the summer)

  ### People

  Some influential people that I met last semester:

  - Anna
  - Miranda
