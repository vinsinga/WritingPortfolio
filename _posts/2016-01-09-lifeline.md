- 2001 - On the 14th of July, I entered this world. Some time in the next four month I gained the courage to speak my first word: "ma."
- 2002 - My family moved - no, escaped - from Florida to Georgia.
- 2009 - By this year, I had already done most of the living
  that I have so far... but little of what's worth writing.
- 20015
  - August - This is the month that I began University.
