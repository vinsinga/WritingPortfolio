### On The Politicization of Culture

---

  A meme is an idea or thing that is spread through a cultural context. The meme is the symbolic, social counterpart to the gene. The internet meme is an odd specification of this concept to a specific context and setting. On the internet, memes are able to spread much more quickly than in any non-digital culture. Internet memes also aspire to a much greater and more cohesive scale, a single image or phrase having the potential to spread from person to person, from website to website, from medium to medium across an arbitrarily large area in an arbitrarily short time, spurred by some simple spectacle.

### The Frog

By nature, internet memes are frequently co-opted, appropriated, recreated, politicised, commodified, and changed. The then Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump, Tweeted out a picture of Pepe the frog along with the caption "You Can't Stump the Trump" and a link to a Youtube video of the same name, that phrase being a meme unto itself. In the picture, Pepe, who began his meme life as a character that would react to things by saying “feels good man,” is wearing the candidate's hair. The frog stands, with a raised brow and hand on his chin, between a podium bearing the seal of the president of the United States of America and an American flag. Trump sent this tweet in October of 2015, long before the Pepe made his way on to the Anti-Defamation League's list of hate symbols nearly a year later. ("ADL")

   Trump’s purpose - and this can likely be said about any politician who does this - in posting memes on his social media accounts is probably an attempt at the creation of an ethos of modernity and coolness, appealing to younger voters, with whom internet memes are popular. Notable are the podium, behind which the frog stands, implying the inevitability of his becoming president, and the brow raised smugly, showcasing confidence. The caption sends the same message. It is an attempt at confidence that almost smells of its antithesis: insecurity. In an article published in the LA Times, Benjamin A. Lyons, a meme researcher at the University of Pennsylvania argues that Trump’s quirks and oddities - his status as a “walking meme” - is the reason for the recent political prevalence of memes.

  Indeed, this election has come to play an important role in the greater internet meme culture, just as memes have come to play an important role in it. Carolina Miranda, the author of the article From Clinton's shimmy to Pepe the frog: Memes are the language of the 2016 election (in which Lyons was quoted) seeks to inform us about all the ways that memes have been utilized this cycle by all elements involved. She first tells us about the days before memes: the archaic and memorable slogans. Then she tells us how things are different now, how Pepe, who she calls a “stoner cartoon frog,” is the new electoral artifact (Miranda).
  
  
### Memes as self defining
---

By their nature, memes derive their apeal from familiarity. Since a meme popularized on websites frequented by teenagers and college students isn't going to be very familiar to tech iliterrate retirees, it's not going to be apealing to them, just like it's not going to be appealing to a number of younger segments of society. So, Donald Trump made his audience clear: the audience for Pepe memes is people famliar with Pepe memes. Hillary Clinton made her audience similarly aperant when she posted her response to Trump's Pepe memes: people unfamiliar with Pepe memes, when she published an article to her website describing Pepe as a "symbol associated with white supremacy (Chan)."

### To conclude
---

The popularity of internet memes among young voters played a part in this year's American presidential elections and, for better or for worse, memes helped to decided the election in favor of the candidate who lent themself better to them.
