I wish that I could say that this portfolio was cohesive, coherent, and calculated. It is not for the very reason that it is a survey of my thoughts and ideas, which are by definition none of those things . The commonalities that have emerged between these pieces say much more about the way my mind works than about my abilities in planning. This is a study in cognition.


I used to love to write. I do love to write. Process has always been hard for me, process and organization. It was something that I never learned. I learned how to format MLA and how to write a five paragraph essay and how to forget about the amount of paragraphs I had, but never how to freewrite. I never understood how to edit or revise. I thought I needed to write  it all right the first time and, if I didn’t, I could only edit by staring at my screen and waiting to find a possible addition or a necessary change. To feel more accomplished, I could print my work out and repeat on paper. 

Those were my struggles. My struggles were those days and weeks that I spent waiting for the muse to sing to me. I struggled the same way in this class, in the beginning. I was and am unorganized, terribly. Just compiling this portfolio required me to build a Frankenstein’s monster from bits and pieces of materials distributed across multiple notebooks and several files (actually, I did this in preparation for our workshops), but I’m learning.


What I learned in this course was process, how to think about writing. I learned how to invent material and how to refine it. I learned so much from the writing itself, having  written very few personal essays before. I loved reading Dillard's book. Reading is in no way a subsitute for writing as practice, but it is definitely a necessary form of practice.

I decided after midterms not to start any new essays. In that way, “On This Wonderful Terrible Day” was a happy accident, inspired by a scene and a song earlier this week. The concept caught me sitting on the green, listening to the Against Me song “Turn Those Clapping Hands Into Angry Balled Fists.” and looked up to see a split in the trees. Half having lost nearly all of their leaves, while the other half still carried their fall colors. Having nothing resembling a clear vision of what the essay should become, but a strange urge to put into words my immediate thoughts, I pulled my math notebook from my bag, having forgotten my others and began to write in pen. Before my bus arrived, I freewrote two pages which would later become the beginning of the essay in a massive, rushed, sloppy handwriting that I would later struggle to interpret to type.

To me, writing that particular essay was the pinnacle of my course experience. I applied almost all of the techniques that we learned in a very short time, pushed by my own desire to finish the pursuit of an organic inspiration.


Truly, I am very happy with the work that I have done in this course and with all of the things that I have learned while doing it. I believe that I have written wonderful writing and that I am much better prepared today for school and life than I was a semester ago. This course was a journey. This portfolio is representative of that journey.
