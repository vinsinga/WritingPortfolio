I spent a lot of time working on the design of this actual website. I really like the way that it looks and I'm proud of how it all fits together, especially how well it compliments my website. That being said, I do need to give credit where it's due:

- http://scribble.muan.co/ - the foundation of this website.
- http://designedbypaul.deviantart.com/art/Ballpoint-Pen-Pencil-sketch-315643593 - the pencil graphic
- Josh - he gave me a lot of tips
