The biggest change in my life to this point, that I can
remember vividly that is, has been beginning university. I
was only fourteen then. For me, that was jarring thing. The
abrupt transition, from being an eclectic homeschooler to
being a student at a large rigid university, was jarring and
had a huge impact on me, as a person and student, and on my
plans and aspirations.

Jarring changes always impact us. They are like being woken
from a long sleep by the pouring of cold water over your
face. They are like being yanked from the sensation of a
good meal when you bite down on your fork. Of course *those*
things don't always leave a mark on us. Usually we escape
with nothing but a memory of a painful, intense, even
frightening experience. Usually we don't bite down too hard.
Actually, we don't bite down hard enough. If the water is
cold enough, it will make us sick. If we hit the fork with
enough passion and force, it will take some of our teeth.
